# Example highlighting animation performance issue with RN Skia

I'm building a music learning game, and I've simplified the use case for the sake of this investigation: a group of notes represented by blue dots need to scroll horizontally and reach the yellow line at a very precise time. The animation needs to be **very** smooth so it doesn't confuse the player.

- Initially, I build this using basic shapes (`<Circle />`, `<RoundedRect />`, ...), but it was very laggy, **especially on the Web**. 

Try it for yourself here: [keen-brioche-53e8c7.netlify.app](https://keen-brioche-53e8c7.netlify.app/)  (click the `Render with Shapes` button).

- After some experimentation, I realized that building it using only `Paths` would make the animation much smoother (even with CPU throttling).
- What confused me, is that in iOS, the animation's performance was pretty much the same with both approach... ðŸ¤”

> Note: I'm using a simple Reanimation with a `useSharedValue` with a `useDerivedValue` to compute the note Group's transform object.

## Build

It's a basic Expo Router app. So run `yarn install` and either build it for mobile `npx expo run:ios` or web `npx expo start --web`.
